# self-checkout-machine
Collaborated with a cross-functional team to create this finished version of a self-checkout machine for a grocery store as part of the UofC SENG-300 course. Took responsibility for designing and implementing an engaging graphical user interface using Java Swing.
# specifics
The self-checkout machine project commenced with random groups of 7 members, each given the task of creating specific use cases and tests, along with the self-checkout machine hardware files. This initial stage was referred to as iteration 1.

In iteration 2, students were reorganized into new groups consisting of 10-15 members. Their task was to create additional specific use cases and tests using both the hardware files and the files from iteration 1.

Subsequently, in iteration 3, students were randomly grouped again, this time with 20-25 members, and were assigned the same tasks as in iteration 2. Additionally, they were required to present a structure diagram of the checkout machine. However, for iteration 3, to provide a more realistic software engineering experience, the course introduced sudden changes to the hardware and use cases. This approach aimed to teach students about adaptability, communication, and time management.
